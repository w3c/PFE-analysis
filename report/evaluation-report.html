    <p>The success of WebFonts is widespread (80%, globally)
        but unevenly distributed.
        In certain areas of the world, usage is <em>zero</em>.
        This study evaluates solutions
        which would allow WebFonts to be used
        where slow networks,
        very large fonts,
        or complex subsetting requirements
        currently preclude their use.</p>

    <h2 class="heading settled" data-level="1" id="deployment"><span class="secno">2. </span><span class="content">Webfont deployment - successes, problems, solutions</span><a class="self-link" href="#deployment"></a></h2>
    <p>
        This section examines the historical deployment of Webfonts
        from their inception in 1997 to date.
        The reasons for the success in deployment are described.
        Then, problems which prevented further deployment are examined.
        Lastly, potential solutions are briefly introduced.
        The detailed evaluation of these solutions comprises the majorty of this report.
    </p>

    <section>
        <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="2" id="fontface"><span class="secno">2.1 </span><span class="content">@font-face</span><a class="self-link" href="#fontface"></a></h3>
        <p>
            Initially introduced in 1997 [<a href="#ref-webfonts">WebFonts</a>]
            and later integrated into CSS2 [<a href="#ref-CSS2">CSS2</a>]
            and SVG1 [<a href="#ref-SVG1">SVG1</a>],
            the CSS <span class="code">@font-face</span>
            allows for the automatic fetching of a font,
            on demand as the stylesheet is used to render a document,
            without user intervention.
            The font is used immediately, without being installed onto the system.
        </p>
        <p>
            This technology was a necessary but not sufficient requirement for deployment.
            At the time, no consensus could be found on a
            single interoperable WebFont format,
            nor on a way to automatically convey licensing and other IPR information.
            Thus, early implementations each used their own format:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Embedded OpenType (MS Internet Explorer 3)</li>
            <li>Portable Font Resources (Netscape Navigator 4/Bitstream)</li>
            <li>SVG Fonts (pre-smartphone SVG implementations)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Due to lack of interoperability,
            plus other technical drawbacks of the initial font formats used,
            when CSS 2.1 [<a href="#ref-CSS21">CSS21</a>] was developed as the "core, interoperable subset" of CSS2,
            <span class="code">@font-face</span> was dropped from the specification.
        </p>
       </section>

       <section>
        <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="2" id="WOFF1"><span class="secno">2.2 </span><span class="content">WOFF 1.0</span><a class="self-link" href="#WOFF1"></a></h3>
        <p>
            Developed between 2010 and 2012, WOFF 1.0 [<a href="#ref-WOFF1">WOFF1</a>],
            compresses each OpenType table separately with gzip,
            and adds optional metadata which can, for example,
            include a link to the license for that font.
            Notably, the user agent is not expected to
            (indeed, is <em><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-WOFF-20121213/#conform-metadata-noeffect">specifically forbidden from</a></em>)
            behaving differently based on the presence, absence, or contents of such metadata.
            This allayed concernes by browser vendors
            that they would be required to police font usage;
            and allayed concerns from font vendors that font data
            would be forever separated from its licensing metadata.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using a lightweight compression scheme which already existed in browsers
            (gzip, used in the PNG image format and also for HTTP compression),
            implementation burden was lessened.
            By offering bit-for-bit lossless compression,
            concerns over "approximate" fonts
            (which had, for example, affected the PFR format)
            were also allayed.
        </p>
        <p>
            By providing an agreed interoperable font format for download,
            which met the requirements of both type vendors and browser vendors,
            WOFF 1.0 was responsible for taking global WebFont usage
            from 0.1% in 2006 to 35% in 2014 [add ref].
        </p>
       </section>

       <section>
        <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="2" id="WOFF2"><span class="secno">2.3 </span><span class="content">WOFF 2.0</span><a class="self-link" href="#WOFF2"></a></h3>

        <p>Developed between 2014 and 2018, WOFF 2.0 [<a href="#ref-WOFF2">WOFF2</a>],
            significantly improves over WOFF 1.0
            by using a font-specific preprocessing step
            followed by Brotli compression.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once WOFF 1.0 had paved the way by demonstrating the utility of WebFonts,
            it was possible to put in place a more complex, but more space efficient
            two-part compression scheme. As the volume of font data worldwide was increasing,
            this was seen as a high priority.
            As it was demonstrated [WOFF2-ER]
            that WOFF 2.0 would never give a worse compression result than WOFF 1.0,
            WOFF 2.0 rapidly became supported by all browsers
            and has taken over from WOFF 1.0.
        </p>

        <p>
            Global webfont usage is now over 80%.

        <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="2" id="static"><span class="secno">2.4 </span><span class="content">Static subsets and unicode-range</span><a class="self-link" href="#static"></a></h3>

        <p>
            CSS has a feature, unicode-range [<a href="#ref-unicode-range">UNICODE-RANGE</a>],
            which states which characters a font *doesn't* have glyphs for.
            This prevents a webfont being needlessly downloaded.

            Combined with static subsetting,
            this greatly reduces the volume of font data for common, monolingual websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, a font which supports Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic
            can be split into three subsets;
            typically only one will be downloaded.
            Google Fonts uses this approach extensively,
            and it works well for languages which use only a small number of glyphs.
        </p>

        <p id="target">
            This study assumes that the <em>target to beat</em> is
            a static subset font,
            with glyph coverage for only the characters actually used,
            compressed with the best available method, WOFF 2.0.

        <p>
            Websites with content languages using the Latin alphabet
            (such as Vietnamese, most European and Africal languages),
            Greek and Cyrillic alphabets,
            and Thai all make modest demands on fonts.
            The number of unique characters is limited,
            typically under a hundred;
            contextual shaping is rare to non-existent,
            and thus fonts are easy to subset and compressed font sizes are very small.

        <p>
            Languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
            have many thousands of characters.
            Font data is thus massive.
            While there is statistical variation in usage from character to character,
            it is not in general possible to statically subset fonts into
            "always used" and "never used" subsets;
            the size of the "sometimes used" group predominates.
        </p>
        <p>
            Static subsetting is unusable,
            font sizes are in the megabytes,
            and mobile Web usage is significant.
        </p>
        <p>
            A 2019 study by the HTTP Archive
            found that the median number of bytes
            used for Web Fonts on websites in China
            was *zero*.

        <p>
            Instead of downloading a static subset
            (or, where static subsetting cannt work, downloading an entire font),
            this proposed solution uses a continuous process of dynamic subsetting.
            A small subsetted font is downloaded,
            which can display the content currently being browsed.
            As the user moves on to other content,
            (or as content is added - for example on user forums or with commenting systems)
            additional data for that font is automatically downloaded
            and te font becomes progressively enriched over time.
            In contrast to fine-grained static subsetting,
            the CSS remains simple
            because the stylesheet sees only a single font,
            not a plethora of related fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
            While this approach has been deployed experimentally
            by several font foundries (

            it is desirable for interoperability
            that a standardized solution for Progressive Font Enrichment (PFE) exists.
        </p>
        <p>
            To ensure that the correct solution is standardized,
            which works with a variety of network conditions
            and content languages,
            the W3C WebFonts Working group was chartered
            to explore the area
            and to run simulation experiments on the proposed solution space
            before undertaking standards-track work.

        <p>
            Two entirely different types of font enrichment have been studied. One requires only a standard Web server, so could be deployed anywhere.
            The other requires an active server extension.
            They make differing tradeoffs and have correspondingly different advantages and disadvantages.
        </p>
        <p>
            In one approach <strong>"Subset and Patch"</strong>,
            the entire font is dynamically subsetted.
            The client and the server communicate closely
            to generate the optimal set of enrichment glyphs
            and other font information
            with each transaction.
            A binary patch is used to update the font stored on the client.
            This tend more closely towards
            the theoretical peak efficiency
            in terms of bytes transfered
            and minimal network latency,
            but requires an intelligent server.
            This approach also allows parameters to be adjusted
            to maximize efficiency
            based on the current network conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the second approach "Glyph Byterange",
            a static subset of the entire font
            (but with <em>zero</em> glyph outlines)
            is downloaded.
            The client then requests glyph outliness as needed
            using standard HTTP byre range requests,
            which are supported on all common servers.
            The efficiency loss from this approach
            depends on the balance of glyph outline data to other font data.
            Efficiency is improved if glyphs are re-ordered in terms of statistical occurrence.
            This approach allows easier deployment,
            because any standard server can be used.
            There is no risk of accidentally breaking font rendering
            due to mis-subsetting complex tables.
            There is no tuning for differing network conditions.
